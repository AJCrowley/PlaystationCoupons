# Playstation Store Coupon Toy

## Idea
Enter a coupon code as a seed,, then count down the number from there until a working coupon code is found.

## Reality
I'm pretty sure they have advanced checksums and such. Even going through thousands of codes, your odds of finding a working one are probably about that of a homeopathic remedy curing your cancer.

## So
This was just written for fun. As much to see if I could actually do it as anything else. Feel free to play with it as much as you like

## How
Go to the Playstation Store, throw something in your basket and go to the "Your Basket" page. You'll see that there's an area to enter a 10 digit coupon code. Throw any 10 digits in there, or just expand it down and leave it blank and the script will generate a random number, then open your Developer Tools. In the console, just paste the contents of the script.
